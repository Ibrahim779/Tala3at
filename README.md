What is the Tala3at? The Tala3a can be an occasion, an outing, an activity, a trip, or a meeting.
In short, it is a group of people who are forced to do a certain thing at a specific time.
Application Tala3at was created to organize this type of Tala3a. You can suggest a new flight and announce it in the application, and those interested in the Tala3a will participate in it with you.
After you create a group chat between the participants to agree on any details regarding the Tala3a.
